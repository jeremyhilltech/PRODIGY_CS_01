Implement Caesar Cipher

In this exercise, I used Python to implement a Caesar Cipher which will accept input from a user that they wish to encrypt. The program takes the input and skews it according to the value of the input submitted by the user, using either postive or negative values, that will in turn output the encrypted text that the user can then deploy as they wish. This function can be used not only for encryption of a given set of values, but also used to decrypt user inputs as well.
