# PRODIGY_CS_01
Implement Caesar Cipher

The program takes user input and skews it according to the desired value, known as the key, using either positive or negative values, that will in turn output the encrypted text that the user may use as they wish. This key can be used to encrypt a set of given input or to decrypt said input using it's negative value.

The caesar cipher was developed around 100 B.C. and was actively used by Julius Caesar so that he could encrypt handwritten messages to keep his military enemies (or anyone else) from discovering his plans should they be intercepted. Pretty amazing!

In this exercise, I learned how to: 
  1. Write comments in the code editor.
  2. Define variables.
  3. Use strings, whole numbers, and floating point numbers and their differences.
  4. Use for, ord, print, chr, if, else, upper, int, and isalpha functions. 
  6. Construct condition statements.
  7. Use a bit of syntactic sugar :)
  8. Set parameters for return of alphabetical characters no matter the shift position of the user input. (Maintains ASCII Code for letters only)
  9. Reduce use of magic numbers through defining variables that make coded functions easier to understand.
  10. Define a function and have it call on arguments for input from the user.
  11. Set up input messages prompting users for specific input.
