# PRODIGY_CS_01
Implement Caesar Cipher

In this exercise, I used Python to implement a Caesar Cipher which will accept input from a user that they wish to encrypt. The program takes the input and skews it according to the value of the input submitted by the user, known as the key, using either positive or negative values, that will in turn output the encrypted text that the user can then deploy as they wish. This key can be used not only for encryption of a given set of values, but also used to decrypt user inputs as well. 

The caesar cipher was created by Julius Caesar so that he could encrypt his handwritten messages to keep his military enemies from discovering his plans should any messages by intercepted. 

In this exercise, I learned how to: 
  1. Write comments in the code editor.
  2. Define variables.
  3. Use strings, whole numbers, and floating point numbers and their differences.
  4. Use for, ord, print, chr, if, else, upper, int, and isalpha functions. 
  6. Construct condition statements.
  7. Use a bit of syntactic sugar :)
  8. Set parameters for return of alphabetical characters no matter the shift position of the user input. (Maintains ASCII Code for letters only)
  9. Reduce use of magic numbers through defining variables that make coded functions easier to understand.
  10. Define a function and have it call on arguments for input from the user.
  11. Set up input messages prompting users for specific input.
